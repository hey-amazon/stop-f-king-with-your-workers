# Stop f**king with your workers

I hope you already read [environmentally-friendly-biz-suggestion](https://github.com/hey-amazon/environmentally-friendly-biz-suggestion) â€” if not: Please do so now.

Here's a list of things you can and should do, Amazon:
- Give them proper health care and proper sick leave.
- Give them equal and proper pay which is 20$/hour minimum (or equal value in other currency).
- Give them bonus on holidays or better yet:
- Give them 40 days of paid holidays, let them pick the dates freely.
- Give them double bonus on Prime Day.
- Allow them to unionize, if they want.
- At the same time: Try to behave so they don't even need to do that last thing.
- Give them a 10% raise every 3 months.
- Include them in profits you make: If you earn 10 dollars share 1-2 dollars of each of those with your workers.

Is that too much to ask? No!

Should there be laws everywhere enforcing a lot of these policies? Yes!

Thanks for your understanding, Jeff
